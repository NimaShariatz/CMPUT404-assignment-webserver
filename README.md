CMPUT404-assignment-webserver
=============================

collaboration:
Assistance was given by Aidan Lynch, specifically regarding how to send data to the client as a server
(i.e the line self.request.sendall(variable.encode)) along with an example of how the printing format looks like for the client
(the header and HTML printout on the client terminal)

past that, no further collaboration was made. No external sources of code were used.
